## Overview

When you provide a `callback_url` in your create task request, we'll send a POST request to that URL when the task completes.

## Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "taskId": "task_xxxxx",
  "state": "success",
  "resultJson": "{\"resultUrls\":[\"https://cdn.example.com/image.png\"]}"
}
```

## Webhook Headers

| Header              | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Content-Type        | application/json                |
| X-Webhook-Signature | HMAC signature for verification |

## Best Practices

1. Respond with 200 status code within 5 seconds
2. Process webhook data asynchronously
3. Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries
4. Verify webhook signatures for security
